# DataMapper-2 (codename: 'The Jersey Thing')

DataMapper has been completely re-written, architecture and in principle. 
This rewrite makes DM2 completely incompatible with DM-1. 

## So what exactly is DM II?
DataMapper II codenamed "A Jersey Thing" has been in development for a long time. Just like its predecessor DM I, it aims to make **Data Object Mapping** the zen layer in applications that manipulate and store data in **Data Stores**. 

__DM-2 has been designed around **Relational Algebra** that makes a very interesting point.__ Google it for the fun lovers. 

##  DM-2 Components
1. **dm-mapper**  Is a mapper to the data store layer. Currently supports postgresql with hope for many other mappers soon.
2. **Veritas**
3. **Virtus**
4. **dm-session**

## Quick Background
This is a quick _Getting Started_ documentation to get you up and running quickly. We hope you will like the new futuristic goodies that have been baked into DM-2.

In our lovely app that we are code-naming "Tomoko", we are going to sell Ruby merchandise specifically Ruby tees, socks, boxers, SSD, coke and coffee to all the Ruby lovers :)).
